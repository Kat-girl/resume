        <h4>Transcript</h4>
        <p>- I just want to talk about the beard for a minute because it's quite something. And how long did it take you
            to grow it, first of all?</p>
        <p>- It was six months, and then I think I had it for an additional year after that.</p>
        <p>- Mm-hmm. And how did people treat you?</p>
        <p>- There's the shot of me.</p>
        <p>- No, that's-- no, that's not what it was during the movie, right? That's cleaned up.</p>
        <p>- No, that was it.</p>
        <p>- Oh, really? Well then it didn't look like that in the movie. It--it--maybe it's 'cause there was so much
            ice on it too 'cause it was always frozen.</p>
        <p>- That was actually wax. I had a fantastic makeup artist in this movie who did all the stuff from the bear
            mauling, and it was wax that she dribbled all over my face every day. It was about a four to five hour
            makeup job every day with all the scars. So again, it was just a joy, the whole experience.</p>
        <p>- But now see, you're growing it back again or something. Or are you just going to keep it at that level?</p>
        <p>- A light stubble. I'm keeping it at a light stubble.</p>
        <p>- A light stubble?</p>
        <p>- Yeah.</p>
        <p>- Do you like wearing a beard?</p>
        <p>- I don't think I'll ever have a beard like that ever again. Unless it's for a role. But yeah, it's hard to
            maintain. It's just--stuff gets in there, you know. You're eating and then food falls in, and you're...</p>
        <p>- Right. And you have to shampoo it, right?</p>
        <p>- You have to shampoo it, yeah.</p>
        <p>- And do you put conditioner in it?</p>
        <p>- I did. I did put conditioner--</p>
        <p>- 'Cause you'd want it to be soft.</p>
        <p>- You do want it to be soft.</p>
        <p>- Right.</p>
        <p>- Otherwise it gets like a Brillo pad.</p>
        <p>- And can you--yes. And who wants to feel that?</p>
        <p>- Who wants it?</p>
        <p>- And when you--when you have food in it, can you tell?</p>
        <p>- It's very visible, yeah. Very visible.</p>
        <p>- I mean, no, but if you don't have a mirror, sometimes do you feel like you've walked around and there's
            been food in your beard?</p>
        <p>- Well, if you have good enough friends, they notify you if you have mustard on your beard or something like
            that.</p>
        <p>- Right.</p>
        <p>- They let you know.</p>
            <p class="lastPar">- All right. Just checking.</p>
